IMAPI for .NET
==============

This is a straight copy of an IMAPI for .NET wrapper library I found on Google Code, abandoned years ago.  I'm not sure if it works, but it was easier for me to import the Subversion repo into a github repo to consume it (instead of infecting my machine with a subversion client ;) ).
